    <h3>Pizza</h3>
       <p> Pizza is an amazingly popular food and Domino's is one of the leading pizzerias in Kenya providing exceptional
        delivery service. The franchise owners Eat’N’Go opened its first Domino’s location on Westlands Fortis Towers.
        As of 2015, Domino’s Pizza Kenya has 7 pizza places that are located throughout the Nairobi and Mombasa and we
        are continually increasing our store numbers in order to serve more customers.</p>

    <h3> Domino's Pizza</h3> (Kenya)
<p> Domino's delivered over 400 million pizzas last year. That's just over one pizza for everyone in the United
        States. Our delivery people drive more than 10 million miles every week to bring you the best pizza we can make.
        We operate over 11,000 pizza places in more than 80 countries dedicated to providing great tasting pizza for
        carryout or delivered to your door. How did we become such a powerhouse of pizza delivery? Let's look.</p>

        <h3>Domino's Pizza History</h3>
    <p>From humble beginnings as a single pizza restaurant in 1960, Domino's Pizza today has become the recognized
        world leader in pizza delivery. We have been dedicated to making and delivering great pizza with high quality
        ingredients from the start. In addition, we are constantly updating and improving our pizza menu.</p>

    <p>Beyond pioneering the concept of efficient delivery of made-to-order pizzas, we have been part of innovations
        that have made a significant impact on the entire food delivery industry:</p>

       <ul><li> Domino's Pizza (Global) pioneered patented insulating pizza bags to keep pizzas oven-hot and crisp during normal
        delivery.</li>
    <li> Domino's (Pizza Global) created the sturdy, corrugated pizza box, which keeps moisture from weakening the box
        and cheese from sticking to the top.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Beyond Pizza Delivery</h3>
        Domino's USA launched online pizza ordering in 2007, and in 2008 revolutionized the online delivery experience
        by launching the innovative Pizza Builder and Domino's Tracker tools. In 2015, Domino’s Kenya launched
        www.dominos.co.ke, which is the first online ordering platform of its kind in the country. The Domino’s Kenya
        site has Pizza Builder which was a step forward in ordering food online, allowing customers to see their pizza
        come to life on the computer screen, while Domino's Tracker was an innovation in food delivery, allowing
        customers to follow the progress of the order from the time it's placed until they receive it. We also added
        pizza coupons and promos to the website in order to provide even more value to our customers. Our innovations
        simply help us get better at what we love to do most: deliver great pizza to your door, efficiently and
        enthusiastically!

    <h3> Not Just Pizza</h3>
        Domino's Pizza offers American, thin crust, and pan crust with a wide variety of toppings, such as our own
        Kachumbari, Nyama Choma, among family combos, value offers on large pizza, and always-on online offers. Side
        items chicken wings, breads, potato wedges, French fries, desserts, and soft drinks. We also proudly serve icy
        cold Coca-Cola®. Domino's has expanded its menu significantly to also include beef, chicken, veggies toppings,
        offering both local and international flavors. In late 2009, Domino's debuted its Inspired New Pizza, a
        permanent change to its core hand-tossed product, reinvented from the crust up with new sauce, cheese and
        garlic-seasoned crust
